# Songs Project

At the same time I was studying my degree I learned to develop web sites through independent learning from books in English language. I developed the site using the ASP.NET Core platform through the use of HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap on the client side and using C#, MVC And Entity Framework on the server side. The site shows a database developed in the MSSQL system. Through the site you can add, edit and delete songs from the database.
